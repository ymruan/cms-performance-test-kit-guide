# How to run the test and analysis the test results

When you run a load test scenario, by default all Vuser information is stored locally on each Vuser host. After scenario execution, the results from all of the hosts are automatically collated or consolidated in the results folder.

You disable automatic collation by choosing **Results** > **Auto Collate Results** from the Controller window, and clearing the check mark adjacent to the option. To manually collate results, choose Results > Collate Results. If your results have not been collated, Analysis will automatically collate the results before generating the analysis data.
