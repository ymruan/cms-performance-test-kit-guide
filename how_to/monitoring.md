# How to add performance counter

### LoadRunner performance monitoring ovewview
You use LoadRunner's System Resource monitors to monitor a machine's system resource usage during a scenario run and isolate server performance bottlenecks.
A primary factor in a transaction's response time is its system resource usage. Using the LoadRunner resource monitors, you can monitor the Windows, UNIX, Server, SNMP, FireWall server, and SiteScope resources on a machine during a scenario run, and determine why a bottleneck occurred on a particular machine.
The resource monitors are automatically enabled when you execute a scenario. However, you must specify the machine you want to monitor and which resources to monitor for each machine. You can also add or remove machines and resources during the scenario run.
